find the unique set of strike prices
separate short puts, short calls, long puts, long calls, short deliverables, long deliverables (same as reg-t)
Sort options by date then by strike 
at each strike price
- walk through the SHORT options
- ignore out of the money options (both short and long)
- pair in the money short options with in the money long options to create long spread pairs
-- favor pairing with like-dates
- pair in the money short calls with long deliverables and in the money short puts with short deliverables
-- favor near-dated options paired with the deliverables
- pair all remaining in the money short options with in the money long options to create short spread pairs
- any in the money short options not paired will be considered 'naked'
